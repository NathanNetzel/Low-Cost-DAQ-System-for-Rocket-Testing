## **Overview**

This system is composed of two stacked PCBs, integrated in a 3D-printed frame:

* **Main DAQ Board**: Handles microcontroller logic, load cell signal conditioning, and serial communication  
* **Pressure Acquisition Board**: Mounted above, adds pressure sensor interface and protection circuitry

Both PCBs work together to safely and accurately acquire thrust and chamber pressure data during motor tests.

# üîÑ Updated Version (2025)

### STM32F373-Based Integrated DAQ System with Ignition and Power Boards

An updated version of the low-cost data acquisition system has been developed.  
While maintaining the same core architecture (STM32F373, load cell conditioning, and modularity), the new design integrates **pressure acquisition into the main board** and adds multiple new features for usability, safety, and flexibility during rocket motor testing.  

The **main goal** of this updated version was to produce a **robust, fully standalone system**, capable of performing rocket motor tests **without requiring a PC or external serial interface**.  
Now, all critical tasks ‚Äî data collection, igniter activation, and real-time monitoring ‚Äî can be carried out directly through the **user button, LCD display, SD card logging, LEDs, and buzzer signals**, providing greater autonomy, safety, and reliability during operations.

## **New Features (Main DAQ Board)**

* **Integrated pressure acquisition** (no separate pressure board required)  
* **Isolated USB interface** with Micro-USB connector using ADUM3166BRSZ  
* **SD Card reader** for standalone data logging  
* **2.4‚Äù 240x320 TFT LCD with touchscreen (ILI9341, SPI)** for real-time data visualization  
* **Protected serial interface** using SN74LVC2T45DCUT to safeguard SD operations  
* **User interaction & signaling**:  
  * 4 user-programmable external LEDs  
  * 3 dedicated power-status LEDs (+3.3V, +5V RS-232, +5V USB)  
  * User button  
  * Buzzer for audio feedback  
* **Load control connectors** for igniter activation (via secondary board)  
* **Expansion connector** with 14 GPIOs (ADC, DAC, Sigma-Delta, etc.)  
* **Power input protection** with rectifier bridge  
* **Improved PCB layout**: reorganized routing, more didactic silkscreen, and compact design

## ‚ö° Igniter Activation Board

The **igniter board** ensures safe activation of rocket motor igniters.  
It operates from a **dedicated 30 V DC power supply** and uses **optical isolation** to decouple control logic from high-current ignition circuits.

**Key Points:**
* Two-channel igniter driver (redundant or independent use)  
* EL817 optocoupler for signal isolation  
* G5LE-14-DC24 relay per channel, driven by BC547 transistor  
* Flyback diodes for coil protection  
* Fail-safe design: both igniter terminals remain shorted to ground when relay is off  
* Output LEDs indicate when a channel is energized (‚ö†Ô∏è load must not be connected when LED is on)

Each board is fed by its own transformer, ensuring electrical separation between subsystems.  

**Features:**
* AC input via transformer  
* Rectifier bridge with filtering capacitors  
* Individual modules used for DAQ and Igniter supply
