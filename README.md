# Low-Cost-DAQ-System-for-Rocket-Testing

### STM32F373-Based Dual-PCB Acquisition System

Hardware project for a modular data acquisition system (DAQ) designed for static fire tests of small rocket engines.  
Built around a precision STM32F373 microcontroller with integrated Sigma-Delta ADCs and analog signal conditioning for both load cell and pressure sensor measurements.

---

## **Overview**

This system is composed of two stacked PCBs, integrated in a 3D-printed frame:

* **Main DAQ Board**: Handles microcontroller logic, load cell signal conditioning, and serial communication  
* **Pressure Acquisition Board**: Mounted above, adds pressure sensor interface and protection circuitry

Both PCBs work together to safely and accurately acquire thrust and chamber pressure data during motor tests.

## **Key Features**

* STM32F373VCT6 microcontroller (16-bit Sigma-Delta ADCs with programmable gain)  
* Load cell signal conditioning using PGA308 programmable gain amplifier  
* Pressure signal acquisition with current-to-voltage conversion and TSV911 buffer  
* RS-232 serial interface (optocoupled) for PC communication via LabVIEW  
* Overvoltage protection for sensor interfaces  
* Modular design for reusability and testing flexibility  
* 3D-printed support structure for mechanical integration
